AB  - Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to answer user-questions from a knowledge graph (KG) by identifying the reasoning relations between topic entity and answer. As a complex branch task of KGQA, multi-hop KGQA requires reasoning over the multi-hop relational chain preserved in KG to arrive at the right answer. Despite recent successes, the existing works on answering multi-hop complex questions still face the following challenges: (i) The absence of an explicit relational chain order reflected in user-question stems from a misunderstanding of a user’s intentions. (ii) Incorrectly capturing relational types on weak supervision of which dataset lacks intermediate reasoning chain annotations due to expensive labeling cost. (iii) Failing to consider implicit relations between the topic entity and the answer implied in structured KG because of limited neighborhoods size constraint in subgraph retrieval-based algorithms. To address these issues in multi-hop KGQA, we propose a novel model herein, namely Relational Chain based Embedded KGQA (Rce-KGQA), which simultaneously utilizes the explicit relational chain revealed in natural language question and the implicit relational chain stored in structured KG. Our extensive empirical study on three open-domain benchmarks proves that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts like GraftNet, PullNet and EmbedKGQA. Comprehensive ablation experiments also verify the effectiveness of our method on the multi-hop KGQA task. We have made our model’s source code available at github: https://github.com/albert-jin/Rce-KGQA.

ABSTRACT = {The end-to-end aspect-based social comment sentiment analysis (E2E-ABSA) task aims to discover human&rsquo;s fine-grained sentimental polarity, which can be refined to determine the attitude in response to an object revealed in a social user&rsquo;s textual description. The E2E-ABSA problem includes two sub-tasks, i.e., opinion target extraction and target sentiment identification. However, most previous methods always tend to model these two tasks independently, which inevitably hinders the overall practical performance. This paper investigates the critical collaborative signals between these two sub-tasks and thus proposes a novel cascade social comment sentiment analysis model for jointly tackling the E2E-ABSA problem, namely CasNSA. Instead of treating the opinion target extraction and target sentiment identification as discrete procedures in previous works, our new framework takes the contextualized target semantic encoding into consideration to yield better sentimental polarity judgment. Additionally, extensive empirical results show that the proposed approach effectively achieves a 68.13% F1-score on SemEval-2014, 62.34% F1-Score on SemEval-2015, 56.40% F1-Score on SemEval-2016, and 50.05% F1-score on a Twitter dataset, which is higher than the existing approaches. Ablated experiments demonstrate that the CasNSA model substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even when using fixed words embedding rather than pre-trained BERT fine tuning. Moreover, in-depth performance analysis on the social comment datasets further validates that our work gains superior performance and reliability effectively and efficiently in realistic scenarios.},
